description: A snazzy demo of SvelteKit's capabilities and how to get most of out it.

This project was created with `npm create svelte@next`, but then [Leaflet maps](map) and MDSvex ([Markdown](about)) were mixed in with love `;-)`

It's a demo of all the cool things you can do with Svelte Kit, which includes ...

- CSR + SSR + prerendering/SSG + hydration
- Routes, pages, REST endpoints, automatic page data loading, etc.
- lots of plugins (e.g. Markdown, SCSS, PostCSS, preprocssing, oh my!)
- Great TypeScript support (including in VSCode)
- Great SEO support (due to SSR and prerendering)

Many interesting features are demo'd on the [about page](about) (writing pages in Markdown+Svelte) and [map page](map) (maintaining map state and data as you navigate to other pages within this site and then come back to that page).

If you're still not convinced about Svelte or SvelteKit, or don't know much about them, then checkout our [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/spinspire).
